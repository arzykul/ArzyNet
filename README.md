# ARZY-G — A Token Born from Usefulness

Web3 created ownership.  
**Web4 creates meaning.**  
ARZY-G is a token that appears only after verified work is done.

## 🔍 What It Solves

- ❌ No mining or staking
- ✅ Tokens are born from useful, confirmed action
- 🌱 Fair, measurable, and transparent

## ⚙️ How It Works (Simplified)

1. Employer reserves a parent token  
2. Worker completes real-world task  
3. Child tokens are born  
4. Reserve returns to the system

## 🧪 Code Structure

- `contracts/` – Token & reserve logic (in progress)
