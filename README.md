> "Value must be born from usefulness, not mining."



ARZY-G is the first Web4 token standard that introduces a new paradigm: tokens are not mined or farmed — they are born from verified usefulness.

This project marks the genesis of Web4 and is officially registered by Genesis NFT #001 on-chain. It is a protocol, a philosophy, and a movement.

🧭 Overview

ARZY-G is not a token, it's a standard. It introduces:

A token born from usefulness, not minting or mining

A built-in record of positive action (workHistory[])

A protocol that rewards contribution over speculation



---

💡 Philosophy

> ARZY-G redefines how we value digital actions.

In Web4, the measure of a person is not how much energy they spend, but how much value they create.



This approach flips the economic model of Web3 on its head. Instead of rewarding computing power, it rewards verified usefulness: social, economic, creative, or technical.

🔐 Smart Contract Logic

The core contract (ARZYG.sol) introduces:

birthToken() — token is born from approved usefulness

reserve — the system or AI that controls issuance

workHistory[] — transparent history of value created

## 🪙 ERC-20 Token: ARZYG_ERC20.sol

To support broader interoperability with Web3 tools, wallets, and exchanges, ARZY-G includes a full ERC-20 compatible version:

**🔧 Contract File:** `contracts/ARZYG_ERC20.sol`

### 🔍 Key Features:
- Fully ERC-20 compliant (transfer, balanceOf, approve, etc.)
- `mint()` and `burn()` controlled by `reserve`
- `changeReserve()` allows safe reassignment of authority
- Ready for integration with DEXs and DeFi protocols

📌 This wrapper maintains ARZY-G's identity while making it compatible with existing ERC-20 infrastructure.

You can review or fork it here: [`contracts/ARZYG_ERC20.sol`](contracts/ARZYG_ERC20.sol)
